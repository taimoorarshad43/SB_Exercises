1. git checkout -b
2. Fast forwards are when you are on a branch and you are trying to merge it into the main branch.
    Recursive merges are when the two branches have diverged and you are trying to merge them together.
3. git checkout -b new_branch
4. git branch -d new_branch
5. merge conflicts happen when there are changes in both branches that cannot be automatically merged by Git. You need to resolve these conflicts manually.

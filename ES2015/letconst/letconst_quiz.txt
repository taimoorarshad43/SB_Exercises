Answers
- Var variables can be redeclared and reassigned whilst let variables can be 
  reassigned but not redeclared. Let variables are block-scoped, meaning they
  are only accessible within the block they are defined in, while var variables
  are function-scoped or globally scoped.
- Var variables can be redeclared and reassigned but const variables
  cannot be redeclared or reassigned. Const variables are also block-scoped,
  like let variables, but they must be initialized at the time of declaration.
- Let variables can be reassigned but not redeclared, while const variables
  cannot be redeclared or reassigned. Both let and const are block-scoped.
- Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations
  are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
  This means that variables can be referenced before they are declared, but only
  var variables are hoisted. Let and const variables are not initialized until
  their declaration is encountered in the code.

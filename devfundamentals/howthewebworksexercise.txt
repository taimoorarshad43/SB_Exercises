1. HTTP is hyper text transfer protocol, which is used to transfer data over the web.
2. A URL is a uniform resource locator, which is the address of a resource on the web.
3. DNS is domain name system, which translates domain names into IP addresses.
4. A query string is a part of a URL that contains data to be sent to the server.
5. One HTTP verb is GET which is used to request data from a server. Another is POST which is used to send data to a server.
6. An HTTP request uses an aforementioned HTTP verb to a server which results in a server action.
7. An HTTP response is the data sent back from the server to the client after processing the request or posting data as an action.
8. An HTTP header is a part of the HTTP request or response that contains metadata about the request or response.
    Some example HTTP response headers are "Content-Type" which indicates the media type of the resource, and "Cache-Control" which specifies caching policies.
    Some example HTTP request headers are "User-Agent" which identifies the client software making the request, and "Accept" which specifies the media types that are acceptable for the response.
9. When you type a URL into a browser
    The browser first checks its cache for a stored version of the resource.
    If not found, it sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name to an IP address.
    The browser then sends an HTTP request to the server at that IP address using the specified URL.
    The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the requested resource or an error message.
    The browser then renders the resource for the user to view.
